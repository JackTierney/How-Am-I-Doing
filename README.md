# How Am I Doing

## Project

### Vision
Young People and their families using Mental Health Services should be in control, in particular, of the data they provide.  It should be available to them to understand their own progress, using the tools to which they have access: mobile phones, tablets, PC’s etc..  Sharing their data with services should be under their control. Data needs to be available in a format that respects their preference and be age-appropriate.

### What is the need?

##### For Young People & Families
* Have no control over own data
* Cannot readily access information tracking progress
* No feedback loop to be able to use data meaningfully and communicate with therapist  - disempowering
* Difficult to review things outside of sessions

##### For Clinicians
* No access to real time information about outcomes to support their work with CYP
* Time spent in sessions inputting and/or analysing data to make it useful
* Doing pointless tasks (data collection with no feedback) damages therapeutic engagement

##### For Services
* Wasteful of resources

### How will this help?

##### Benefits for Users
* Clear intelligible feedback
* Access to and control of personal data
* Share clear information instantly with clinicians

##### Benefits for Clinicians
*	Notice change or its absence

##### Benefits for Services
*	Improved data quantity and quality

### Core Features
*	Collects RCADS outcome data for mood and  displays time – series of collected data in accessible and engaging way for young people.
*	Permits the sharing of that information with clinicians and others

### Young People’s Decision Making Capacity and Data Management
*	How can parents, clinicians and young people negotiate who should be in charge of this data given legislation on parental responsibility and Fraser guidelines on decision capacity of young people?
*	How should risk be communicated, if detected in the use of this app.  To whom should it be communicated: YP, parent clinician?

### Roadmap
* Development of an initial prototype for user testing (launched 10/06/2016)
* Initial user testing phase (undefined duration)
* If funding available, further development based on feedback, as well as considering the following features:
  * Links to self-help resources
  * 'Crisis' prompts based on worsening results
  * Improving the user experience
  * Generalising the backend to allow the project to be deployed with different sets of questionnaires (other than RCADS)

### Sponsors
With thanks to the Anna Freud Centre for funding the initial development sprint
